}}'''Bakery''' turns [[File:Flour.png|20px|link=Flour Mill]] [[Flour Mill|flour]] into [[File:Bread.png|20px]] bread, the basic [[Needs|need]] of {{Infoicon Workers}} and {{Infoicon Artisans}}. It can be built only in the [[Old World]].

For a detailed look into the profitability of bread as a consumer product, see [[Profitability of Consumer Goods|this page]].

== Productivity ==
It takes 60 seconds to produce 1 ton of bread from 1 ton of flour so the production rate is 1 ton of bread per minute. Productivity can be changed by adjusting [[working conditions]], using [[items]] and [[electricity]].

{{clear}}
== Bread usage and production chains ==
'''Bread''' fulfills the basic need of {{Infoicon Workers}} and {{Infoicon Artisans}}.

Bread can be used during [[expeditions]] as extra rations, it grants 5 bonus points to faith skill per 50 tons. It can also be sold for 84 coins, or purchased for 210 coins per ton (by [[Trade|passive trading]]).

All [[production chains]] involving bread are listed below.
