It can be built only in the [[Old World]], it requires free coastline. It must be connected to a [[Small_Warehouse|warehouse]] or a [[Trading Post|trading post]] by a [[roads|road]] to enable goods transportation; adjacency to the trading post is not sufficient. Fish are needed to fulfill the basic [[Needs|need]] of {{Infoicon Farmers}} and {{Infoicon Workers}}.

For a detailed look into the profitability of fish as a consumer product, see [[Profitability of Consumer Goods|this page]].

== Productivity ==
It takes 30 seconds to produce 1 ton of fish so the production rate is 2 tons of fish per minute. Productivity can be changed by adjusting [[working conditions]] and using [[items]]. [[Electricity]] has no effect on fisheries.

== Fish usage and production chains ==
'''Fish''' is the first farmers' basic need based on goods. Fulfilling the need for fish increases the number of farmers and workers in each residence by 3.

Fish can be used on [[expeditions]] as extra rations, they grant 15 bonus morale per 50 tons. They can also be sold for 16 coins, or purchased for 40 coins per ton (by [[Trade|passive trading]]).

All [[production chains]] involving fish are listed below.

== Items ==
Some items when equipped in [[Trade Union|trade unions]] or [[Harbourmaster's Office|harbourmaster's offices]] can have an impact on fisheries. Below you can find three lists of such items. The first part of the list contains items affecting only particular buildings including fisheries, the list is divided by rarity. The second list contains items affecting every production building in the game. The third list contains items affecting every harbour building.
