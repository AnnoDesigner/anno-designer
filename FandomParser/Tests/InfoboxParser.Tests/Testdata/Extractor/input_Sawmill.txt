}}'''Sawmill''' turns [[File:Wood.png|20px]] [[Lumberjack's Hut|wood]] into [[File:Timber.png|20px]] timber, the first construction material available. It can be built in both [[Old World]] and [[New World]].

== Productivity ==
It takes 15 seconds to produce 1 ton of timber from 1 ton of wood so the production rate is 4 tons of timber per minute. Productivity can be changed by adjusting [[working conditions]], using [[items]] and [[electricity]].

{{clear}}
== Timber usage and production chains ==
'''Timber''' is the first and most important construction material, it is used to construct almost every building in the game and to construct all sailing [[ships]].

Timber can be used during [[expeditions]], it grants 20 bonus points to crafting skill per 50 tons. It can also be sold for 4 coins, or purchased for 10 coins per ton (by [[Trade|passive trading]]). Timber can also be actively bought from [[Sir Archibald Blake|Archibald Blake]] or [[Old Nate]] (DLC) for 10 coins.

All [[production chains]] involving timber are listed below.

=== Old World ===
{{PCList|Timber (Farmers)}}

=== New World ===
{{PCList|Timber (Jornaleros)}}

== Items ==
Some items when equipped in [[Trade Union|trade unions]] can have an impact on sawmills. Below you can find two lists of such items. The first part of the list contains items affecting only particular buildings including sawmills, the list is divided by rarity. The second list contains items affecting every production building in the game.
