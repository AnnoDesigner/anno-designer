## Summary

The **Anno Designer** is a standalone windows application that can be used for creating and exporting layouts. It uses a drag/drop system and is intuitive and easy to use.  
**The Anno Designer supports the following Anno versions: 1404, 2070, 2205, 1800**.

## How to use

**Download the latest version from the [here](https://github.com/AnnoDesigner/anno-designer/releases/tag/AnnoDesignerv9.4)** (select the .exe file). Run it, and use it to design layouts!

Anno Designer can also be started from the command line for advanced usages.  
Please see [this documentation](doc/CommandLineParameters.md) for more information and examples.

## Technology

This application is written in C# (.NET Framework 4.8) and uses WPF.  
The .NET Framework is available via Windows Update and further information about installing is available on [this site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/).

## Game data and icons

The building presets and icons are extracted from game files using the [RDA explorer](https://github.com/lysannschlegel/RDAExplorer) and a custom script written by Peter Hozak.  
See the development pages at wikia: <http://anno2070.wikia.com/wiki/Development_Pages>

[StingMcRay](https://github.com/StingMcRay) has also done a lot of work on this, extracting icons from Anno 2205 and Anno 1800.

Included in this repo is a modified version of the PresetParser - which supports the extraction of data from all the different Anno versions. It is not required to run the app (and is not included in any release).
