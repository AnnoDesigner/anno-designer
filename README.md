## Summary

The **Anno Designer** is a standalone windows application that can be used for creating and exporting layouts. It uses a drag/drop system and is intuitive and easy to use. **The Anno Designer supports the following Anno versions: 1404, 2070, 2205, 1800**.

## How to use

**Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AgmasGold/anno-designer/releases)**. Run it, and use it to design layouts!

## Technology

This application is written in C# (.Net Framework 4.7.2) and uses WPF.

## Game data and icons

The building presets and icons are extracted from game files using the [RDA explorer](https://github.com/lysannschlegel/RDAExplorer)  and a custom script written by Peter Hozak. See the development pages at wikia: http://anno2070.wikia.com/wiki/Development_Pages

Sting_McRay has also done a lot of work on this, extracting icons from Anno 2205 and Anno 1800.

Included in this repo is a modified version of the PresetParser - which supports the extraction of data from all the different Anno versions. It is not required to run the app (and is not included in any release).
